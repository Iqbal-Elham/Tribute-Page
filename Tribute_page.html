                            </strong> - At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[70] finding the net twice in a 7–1 victory over Roma.[71] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[72] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[73] He also helped United reach the FA Cup final, but the decisive match against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.[74] Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May 2007 (his 50th goal for the club), as Manchester United claimed their first Premier League title in four years.[75] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player, and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[76][77] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[78] His club wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week (£31 million total) as part of a five-year contract extension with United.[79] At the end of 2007, Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the Ballon d'Or,[80] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the FIFA World Player of the Year award

                                </strong> - Ahead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery,[99] which kept him out of action for 10 weeks.[100] Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November,[101] which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time.[102] At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan,[103] assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process.[104] He subsequently became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since George Best in 1968,[105] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.[106]

                                His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[107] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[108] United advanced to the final in Rome,[109] where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.[110] Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive Premier League title and a Football League Cup.[111][112] He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.[113] His final ever goal for Manchester United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.
